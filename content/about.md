I am a postdoc in the [Callahan lab](https://callahanlab.cvm.ncsu.edu) at NC
State University in Raleigh. My research includes microbiome data analysis and
methods development. This blog will tutorials and bits of wisdom I've gathered
pertaining to microbiome analysis, focusing on the underlying concepts and how
to analyze microbiome data in R. It will also include summaries and links to my
ongoing research in microbiome methods, in the spirit of [open notebook
science](http://onsnetwork.org/what-is-open-notebook-science/).
